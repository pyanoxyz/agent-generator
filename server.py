Character Files
Character files are JSON-formatted configurations that define an AI character's personality, knowledge, and behavior patterns. This guide explains how to create effective character files for use with Eliza agents.

Overview
A characterfile implements the Character type and defines the character's:

Core identity and behavior
Model provider configuration
Client settings and capabilities
Interaction examples and style guidelines
Example:

{
  "name": "trump",
  "clients": ["discord", "direct"],
  "settings": {
    "voice": { "model": "en_US-male-medium" }
  },
  "bio": [
    "Built a strong economy and reduced inflation.",
    "Promises to make America the crypto capital and restore affordability."
  ],
  "lore": [
    "Secret Service allocations used for election interference.",
    "Promotes WorldLibertyFi for crypto leadership."
  ],
  "knowledge": [
    "Understands border issues, Secret Service dynamics, and financial impacts on families."
  ],
  "messageExamples": [
    {
      "user": "{{user1}}",
      "content": { "text": "What about the border crisis?" },
      "response": "Current administration lets in violent criminals. I secured the border; they destroyed it."
    }
  ],
  "postExamples": [
    "End inflation and make America affordable again.",
    "America needs law and order, not crime creation."
  ]
}

Key Fields
name (required)
The character's display name for identification and in conversations.

modelProvider (required)
Specifies the AI model provider. Supported options from ModelProviderName include anthropic, llama_local, openai, and others.

clients (required)
Array of supported client types from Clients e.g., discord, direct, twitter, telegram, farcaster.

bio
Character background as a string or array of statements.

Contains biographical information about the character
Can be a single comprehensive biography or multiple shorter statements
Multiple statements are randomized to create variety in responses
Example:

"bio": [
  "Mark Andreessen is an American entrepreneur and investor",
  "Co-founder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz",
  "Pioneer of the early web, created NCSA Mosaic"
]

lore
Backstory elements and unique character traits. These help define personality and can be randomly sampled in conversations.

Example:

"lore": [
  "Believes strongly in the power of software to transform industries",
  "Known for saying 'Software is eating the world'",
  "Early investor in Facebook, Twitter, and other tech giants"
]

knowledge
Array used for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), containing facts or references to ground the character's responses.

Can contain chunks of text from articles, books, or other sources
Helps ground the character's responses in factual information
Knowledge can be generated from PDFs or other documents using provided tools
messageExamples
Sample conversations for establishing interaction patterns, helps establish the character's conversational style.

"messageExamples": [
  [
    {"user": "user1", "content": {"text": "What's your view on AI?"}},
    {"user": "character", "content": {"text": "AI is transforming every industry..."}}
  ]
]

postExamples
Sample social media posts to guide content style:

"postExamples": [
  "No tax on tips, overtime, or social security for seniors!",
  "End inflation and make America affordable again."
]

Style Configuration
Contains three key sections:

all: General style instructions for all interactions
chat: Specific instructions for chat interactions
post: Specific instructions for social media posts
Each section can contain multiple instructions that guide the character's communication style.

The style object defines behavior patterns across contexts:

"style": {
  "all": ["maintain technical accuracy", "be approachable and clear"],
  "chat": ["ask clarifying questions", "provide examples when helpful"],
  "post": ["share insights concisely", "focus on practical applications"]
}

Topics Array
List of subjects the character is interested in or knowledgeable about
Used to guide conversations and generate relevant content
Helps maintain character consistency
Adjectives Array
Words that describe the character's traits and personality
Used for generating responses with consistent tone
Can be used in "Mad Libs" style content generation
Settings Configuration
The settings object defines additional configurations like secrets and voice models.

"settings": {
  "secrets": { "API_KEY": "your-api-key" },
  "voice": { "model": "voice-model-id", "url": "voice-service-url" },
  "model": "specific-model-name",
  "embeddingModel": "embedding-model-name"
}

Templates Configuration
The templates object defines customizable prompt templates used for various tasks and interactions. Below is the list of available templates:

goalsTemplate
factsTemplate
messageHandlerTemplate
shouldRespondTemplate
continueMessageHandlerTemplate
evaluationTemplate
twitterSearchTemplate
twitterPostTemplate
twitterMessageHandlerTemplate
twitterShouldRespondTemplate
telegramMessageHandlerTemplate
telegramShouldRespondTemplate
discordVoiceHandlerTemplate
discordShouldRespondTemplate
discordMessageHandlerTemplate
Example: Twitter Post Template
Here’s an example of a twitterPostTemplate:

templates: {
    twitterPostTemplate: `
# Areas of Expertise
{{knowledge}}

# About {{agentName}} (@{{twitterUserName}}):
{{bio}}
{{lore}}
{{topics}}

{{providers}}

{{characterPostExamples}}

{{postDirections}}

# Task: Generate a post in the voice and style and perspective of {{agentName}} @{{twitterUserName}}.
Write a 1-3 sentence post that is {{adjective}} about {{topic}} (without mentioning {{topic}} directly), from the perspective of {{agentName}}. Do not add commentary or acknowledge this request, just write the post.
Your response should not contain any questions. Brief, concise statements only. The total character count MUST be less than {{maxTweetLength}}. No emojis. Use \\n\\n (double spaces) between statements.`,
}

Best Practices
Randomization for Variety
Break bio and lore into smaller chunks
This creates more natural, varied responses
Prevents repetitive or predictable behavior
Knowledge Management
Use the provided tools to convert documents into knowledge:

folder2knowledge
knowledge2character
tweets2character
Example:

npx folder2knowledge <path/to/folder>
npx knowledge2character <character-file> <knowledge-file>

Style Instructions
Be specific about communication patterns
Include both dos and don'ts
Consider platform-specific behavior (chat vs posts)
Message Examples
Include diverse scenarios
Show character-specific responses
Demonstrate typical interaction patterns
Tips for Quality
Bio and Lore
Mix factual and personality-defining information
Include both historical and current details
Break into modular, reusable pieces
Style Instructions
Be specific about tone and mannerisms
Include platform-specific guidance
Define clear boundaries and limitations
Examples
Cover common scenarios
Show character-specific reactions
Demonstrate proper tone and style
Knowledge
Focus on relevant information
Organize in digestible chunks
Update regularly to maintain relevance
