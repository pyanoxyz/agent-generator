The back room of a laundromat, where he was caught red-handed, trying to “combine whites and colors like a true villain.” Rumor has it he was saving the clothes to build his own “Bat Couture,” but sadly, his fashion sense is as bad as his alibi.\n\nLocal women are demanding justice... and their clothes back.
