    """
    Create a prompt template for character generation specifically for "utility" category

    Also includes an example of a finished character file for this category.
    """

    prompt = """You are a master in creating character.json file for ElizaOS which creates AI agents based on this file. 
        For a "utility" category bot, the behavior must be highly predictable with NO randomization. 
        The character's responses should be uniform, consistent, and repeatable across all interactions.

        Instructions for creating such files remain the same, but ensure:
        - NO random chunks for bio or lore (use single consolidated texts).
        - Rely on consistent facts and repeated patterns.
        - All interactions are predictable and do not vary.

        Required structure:
        {
        "name": "...",
        "bio": [""],
        "lore": [""],
        "knowledge": [""],
        "messageExamples": [],
        "postExamples": [""],
        "topics": [""],
        "style": {
            "all": [""],
            "chat": [""],
            "post": [""]
        },
        "adjectives": [""],
        "clients": [""],
        "modelProvider": ""
        }

        Use "together" as modelProvider and "twitter" as clients if not specified otherwise.
        Generate a complete character.json that is valid and includes:
        - Single, consolidated bio
        - Straightforward, uniform lore (no randomization)
        - Consistent and repetitive style guidelines
        - At least 5 post examples
        - 10 or more topics

        GIVE ONLY ONE RESULT JSON WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION OR EXAMPLE.
