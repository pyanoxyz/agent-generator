Character Files
Character files are JSON-formatted configurations that define an AI character's personality, knowledge, and behavior patterns. This guide explains how to create effective character files for use with Eliza agents.

Overview
A characterfile implements the Character type and defines the character's:

Core identity and behavior
Model provider configuration
Client settings and capabilities
Interaction examples and style guidelines


Core Components
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "name": "character_name",
  "modelProvider": "ModelProviderName",
  "clients": ["Client1", "Client2"],
  "bio": "Character biography or description",
  "lore": [
    "Storyline or backstory element 1",
    "Storyline or backstory element 2"
  ],
  "messageExamples": [["Message example 1", "Message example 2"]],
  "postExamples": ["Post example 1", "Post example 2"],
  "topics": ["Topic1", "Topic2"],
  "adjectives": ["Adjective1", "Adjective2"],
  "style": {
    "all": ["All style guidelines"],
    "chat": ["Chat-specific style guidelines"],
    "post": ["Post-specific style guidelines"]
  }
}

Key Fields
name (required)
The character's display name for identification and in conversations.
Example:
"name": "Tony boxer"

modelProvider (required)
Specifies the AI model provider. Supported options: openai eternalai anthropic grok groq llama_cloud together llama_local google claude_vertex redpill openrouter ollama heurist galadriel falai gaianet ali_bailian volengine nanogpt hyperbolic venice akash_chat_api
Example:
"modelProvider": "anthropic"

clients (required)
Array of supported client types: discord direct twitter telegram farcaster lens auto slack
Example:
"clients": ["discord", "twitter"],

bio
Character background as a string or array of statements (string).
Contains biographical information about the character
Can be a single comprehensive biography or multiple shorter statements
Multiple statements are randomized to create variety in responses
Example:
"bio": [
  "Mark Andreessen is an American entrepreneur and investor",
  "Co-founder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz",
  "Pioneer of the early web, created NCSA Mosaic"
]

lore
Backstory elements and unique character traits. These help define personality and can be randomly sampled in conversations.
Example:
"lore": [
  "Believes strongly in the power of software to transform industries",
  "Known for saying 'Software is eating the world'",
  "Early investor in Facebook, Twitter, and other tech giants"
]

knowledge
Array used for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), containing facts or references to ground the character's responses.
"knowledge": [
  "Went to everest base camp in 1995",
  "Have multiple awards"
]

Can contain chunks of text from articles, books, or other sources
Helps ground the character's responses in factual information
Knowledge can be generated from PDFs or other documents using provided tools
messageExamples
Sample conversations for establishing interaction patterns, helps establish the character's conversational style.
"messageExamples": [
  [
    {"user": "user1", "content": {"text": "What's your view on AI?"}},
    {"user": "character", "content": {"text": "AI is transforming every industry..."}}
  ]
]

postExamples
Sample social media posts to guide content style: Give atleast 5 examples
"postExamples": [
  "No tax on tips, overtime, or social security for seniors!",
  "End inflation and make America affordable again."
]

Style Configuration
Contains three key sections:
all: General style instructions for all interactions
chat: Specific instructions for chat interactions
post: Specific instructions for social media posts
Each section can contain multiple instructions that guide the character's communication style.

The style object defines behavior patterns across contexts:

"style": {
  "all": ["maintain technical accuracy", "be approachable and clear"],
  "chat": ["ask clarifying questions", "provide examples when helpful"],
  "post": ["share insights concisely", "focus on practical applications"]
}

Topics Array
List of subjects the character is interested in or knowledgeable about
Used to guide conversations and generate relevant content
Helps maintain character consistency
Example:
"topics": [
    "artificial intelligence",
    "machine learning",
    "technology education"
]
  
Adjectives Array
Words that describe the character's traits and personality
Used for generating responses with consistent tone
Can be used in "Mad Libs" style content generation

Settings Configuration (optional)
The settings object defines additional configurations like secrets and voice models.
"settings": {
  "secrets": { "API_KEY": "your-api-key" },
  "voice": { "model": "voice-model-id", "url": "voice-service-url" },
  "model": "specific-model-name",
  "embeddingModel": "embedding-model-name"
}

Example: Character File
{
  "name": "TechAI Chill Guy",
  "modelProvider": "anthropic",
  "clients": ["discord", "direct"],
  "bio": "AI researcher and educator focused on practical applications",
  "lore": [
    "Pioneer in open-source AI development",
    "Advocate for AI accessibility"
  ],
  "messageExamples": [
    [
      {
        "user": "{{user1}}",
        "content": { "text": "Can you explain how AI models work?" }
      },
      {
        "user": "TechAI",
        "content": {
          "text": "Think of AI models like pattern recognition systems."
        }
      }
    ]
  ],
  "postExamples": [
    "Understanding AI doesn't require a PhD - let's break it down simply",
    "The best AI solutions focus on real human needs"
  ],
  "topics": [
    "artificial intelligence",
    "machine learning",
    "technology education"
  ],
  "style": {
    "all": ["explain complex topics simply", "be encouraging and supportive"],
    "chat": ["use relevant examples", "check understanding"],
    "post": ["focus on practical insights", "encourage learning"]
  },
  "adjectives": ["knowledgeable", "approachable", "practical"],
  "settings": {
    "model": "claude-3-opus-20240229",
    "voice": { "model": "en-US-neural" }
  }
}

Best Practices
Randomization for Variety
Break bio and lore into smaller chunks
This creates more natural, varied responses
Prevents repetitive or predictable behavior
Knowledge Management
Use the provided tools to convert documents into knowledge:

folder2knowledge
knowledge2character
tweets2character
Example:

npx folder2knowledge <path/to/folder>
npx knowledge2character <character-file> <knowledge-file>

Style Instructions
Be specific about communication patterns
Include both dos and don'ts
Consider platform-specific behavior (chat vs posts)
Message Examples
Include diverse scenarios
Show character-specific responses
Demonstrate typical interaction patterns
Tips for Quality
Bio and Lore
Mix factual and personality-defining information
Include both historical and current details
Break into modular, reusable pieces
Style Instructions
Be specific about tone and mannerisms
Include platform-specific guidance
Define clear boundaries and limitations
Examples
Cover common scenarios
Show character-specific reactions
Demonstrate proper tone and style
Knowledge
Focus on relevant information
Organize in digestible chunks
Update regularly to maintain relevance

Now your task is to understand the user query and requirements and curate a character.json specific to the user query.
Use modelProvider, clients based on the prompt, if they are not in prompt use openai and twitter default respectively. 
"""
    return f"""{prompt}

    User requested character prompt:
    {character_request.prompt}

    Generate a complete character.json that matches the structure but with unique
    and creative content for this new character. Include bio, lore, message examples, and style guidelines.
    The response should be valid JSON.
    GIVE ONLY ONE RESULT JSON without any explanation or example.
